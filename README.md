# music-store-data-analysis
Music Store Analysis!  I analyzed a full relational database to uncover insights such as total invoice revenue, top-performing cities, customer spending behavior, music genre popularity, longest tracks, employee hierarchy, and more.  This project strengthened my skills in Joins, Group By, Having, Aggregate Functions, Subqueries, and Data Analysis.
